# Tekton Catalog Roadmap

This doc describes the roadmap for [the Tekton Catalog](https://github.com/tektoncd/catalog).

The catalog is a key piece of
[Tekton's mission](https://github.com/tektoncd/community/blob/master/roadmap.md#mission-and-vision).
In 2019 we got a solid start on a catalog of reusable `Tasks` and in 2020 we want to keep this momentum
going and make the catalog even more useful by adding:

* [Component versioning](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/issues/1839)
* Clear indications of which versions of Tekton Pipelines (and Triggers) a component
  is compatible with
* A clear story around ownership of components
* [Support for custom catalogs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O8VHZ-7tNuuRjPNjPfdo8bD--WDrkcz-lbtJ3P8Wugs/edit#)
* Support for more components, e.g. `Pipelines` and `TriggerTemplates` in
  addition to `Tasks`
* Increased confidence in component quality through:
  * Clear testing requriements
  * Support for testing components that depend on external services
* Increased documentation and examples
* Well defined Tekton API conformance
